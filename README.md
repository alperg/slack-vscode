### Installation
You can install this extension by pressing F1 in Visual Studio Code, then typing "ex install" and selecting it from the list.

### Slack integration
Based on the latest updates on Slack API, you can no longer create legacy token to connect this extension to your Slack workspace. 

Create a new Slack App from https://api.slack.com/apps/ and add the following OAuth Scopes to "Bot Token":

* incoming-webhook
* channels:read
* chat:write
* chat:write.customize
* files:write
* groups:read
* im:read
* mpim:read

You can then copy and paste the token into your VS Code settings file. The token should start with **"xoxb-"**.

**Do not forget to add the app's bot user to channels you want to post to.**

### VS Code Configuration
Go to User Settings (File > Preferences > User Settings) and add the following 
```
  "slackVSCode.token": "<your slack app's token>",
  "slackVSCode.listChannels": true,
  "slackVSCode.listGroups": false,
  "slackVSCode.listMembers": false,
  "slackVSCode.fileWithFullPath": true,
  "slackVSCode.excludeFromFullPath": "/Users/alper/dev",
  "slackVSCode.defaultRecipient": "<channel or user name i.e. #general>"
```
